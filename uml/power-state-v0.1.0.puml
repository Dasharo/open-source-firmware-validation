title OSFV Power state requirements - v0.1.0\nHigh priority (tells us whether we can implement some form of automatic power control)

skinparam participantBorderColor #38d430
skinparam participantPadding 0
skinparam SequenceParticipantBorderThickness 3
skinparam participantBackgroundColor #white

participant "Power state after\npower failure?" as PowerState
participant "Power/reset buttons\nexposed on GPIO headers?" as PowerGPIO
participant "Is there another way to\nconnect to those signals?" as PowerOther

skinparam participantBackgroundColor #38d430

participant "Connect them to\nRTE GPIO header" as output1
participant "Power/reset buttons control is not\nmandatory (but is still useful for\ntests such as waking up from suspend)" as output2
participant "Power control cannot be\nimplemented. Manual power\ncontrol must be used." as output3

PowerState -> PowerGPIO: Powered off
PowerGPIO -> output1: Yes
PowerOther -> output1: Yes

PowerState --> output2
PowerGPIO --> PowerOther: No
PowerOther --> output3: No
