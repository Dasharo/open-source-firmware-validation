    [Documentation]    XMP DRAM profiles have higher memory frequencies and/or
    ...    timings and are often necessary to get sticks to perform as
    ...    advertised by its manufacturer. Enabling such profile should keep
    ...    the system operational and change memory speed to a higher one.
