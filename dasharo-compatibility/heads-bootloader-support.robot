# Notes on menu option keys:
# - check for them explicitly, so we won't go into wrong menu if they change
# - read until end of ASCII window before choosing option, but check for the
#    option explicitly for better error messages
# - 'Write Bare Into Terminal' letter and ${ENTER} as separate commands, a small
#    delay is required
# - cases don't matter, both select the same option
# - if multiple options use the same (case-insensitive) letter, they are
#    selected top to bottom and don't loop back to the top
