*** Keywords ***
Get SMBIOS Values
    [Documentation]    Get the dump of SMBIOS tables (BIOS, System, Base Board
    ...    and Chassis) and store them in suite variables. Each table is stored
    ...    in a dedicated variable because their fields have generic names (e.g.
    ...    Type) that is later extracted in the test cases.
