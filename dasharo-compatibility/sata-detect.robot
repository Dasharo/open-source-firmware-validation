SAT001.002 SATA support in OS (Ubuntu)
    [Documentation]    This test aims to verify that SATA is detected from OS
    ...    by using smartctl.
    Depends On    ${TESTS_IN_FIRMWARE_SUPPORT}

    Depends On    ${SATA_SUPPORT}

    Power On
    Boot System Or From Connected Disk    ubuntu
    Login To Linux
    Switch To Root User
