*** Test Cases ***
# For now, the test has to be done manually, because of the issue with rtcwake:
# https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/485

# Manual test steps:
#    1. Power on the DUT
#    2. Login to Linux
#    3. Open terminal window and execute following command: "systemctl hibernate"
#    4. When the machine finishes hibernation process, wake it up by pressing the
#    power button

# Expected result:
#    1. The DUT should power back on
#    2. All previously opened windows should remain open
