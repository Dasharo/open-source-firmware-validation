*** Test Cases ***

Verify number of connected SD Wire devices
    [Documentation]    Test confirms the number of connected SD Wire devices to
    ...    the DUT platform.
    ${sd_wire_id_list}=    Get List Of SD Wire Ids
    ${length_of_sd_wire_id_list}=    Get Length    ${sd_wire_id_list}
    # we are currently doing this because we only expect one SD Wire
    Should Be Equal    ${length_of_sd_wire_id_list}    ${SD_WIRES_CONNECTED}
    FOR    ${index}    IN RANGE    0    ${SD_WIRES_CONNECTED}
        Should Be Equal    ${sd_wire_id_list[${index}]}    ${SD_WIRE_SERIAL1}
    END

Flash platform and verify
    [Documentation]    This test flashes the DUT connected to the RTE through
    ...    the SD Wire, then attempts to log into it over serial to see whether
    ...    it works.
    Run Keyword If    '${PREV TEST STATUS}' == 'FAIL'    Fail    'Incorrect number of connected SD Wire devices.'
    Variable Should Exist    ${DUT_PASSWORD}
