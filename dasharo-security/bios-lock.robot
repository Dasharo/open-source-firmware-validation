*** Test Cases ***
BLS001.001 BIOS lock support (Ubuntu)
    [Documentation]    BIOS lock is a method to prevent a specific region of the
    ...    firmware from being flashed. This test aims to verify that,
    ...    after turning on the mechanism, the BIOS region should be correctly
    ...    recognized during attempt to overwrite it by using flashrom tool.
