SMM001.001 SMM BIOS write protection enabling (Ubuntu 22.04)
    [Documentation]    SMM BIOS write protection is the method to prevent a
    ...    specific region of the firmware from being flashed - when enabled
    ...    allows only SMM code (the privileged code installed by the firmware
    ...    in the system memory) to write to BIOS flash. This test aims to
    ...    verify that, the SMM BIOS protection option is available in the
    ...    Dasharo Security Options and, if the mechanism works correctly -
    ...    during the attempt of firmware flashing information about the
    ...    SMM protection is returned.
